# Biodiv project

# Next up
<<<<<<< HEAD
- [ ] make detection runnable from command line.
    - returns green rectangle and saves it to pic_det.ext
- Use the labeller from Docker: Can we render image directly from container or does it needs a webapp ?
- 2-container process: add either flask app or DB (Mongo ?)
=======
- redo tests with labelled images
- check if Travis works now.
- fix git prompt in iterminal
- Load everything in docker.
