# Biodiv project

# Next up
- [ ] make detection runnable from command line.
    - returns green rectangle and saves it to pic_det.ext
- Use the labeller from Docker: Can we render image directly from container or does it needs a webapp ?
- 2-container process: add either flask app or DB (Mongo ?)


## mid term
- super simple web app to wrap functions above.
    - 1 container for the app, one for the detection.
- put it on AWS.
- add detection with YOLO instead of biodiv.

## Goal of the project
- [x] Practice testing 
- [x] First foray into CI/CD
- [ ] docker
- [ ] combine above on the cloud.
